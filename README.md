# clusteredcrimemaps
This repository will contain all the maps and code for the algorithmic discrimination project.

**June 13:** Have 1st exemplars of interactive crime maps up.

Theft Maps:
Data Conversion and Formatting notebook takes the spreadsheets and converts them into a single pandas document
which can then be saved as a csv file to be used later. It also handles the geocoding of the addresses.

Theft notebook displays a rudimentary version of the map, which still needs some heavy editing.

CrimeData:
Folder contains the spreadsheets for the 15 aldermanic districts as well as several publically avaiable shape files
that were used at various stages of map drawing. Some may no longer be useful.
